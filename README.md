# Re-former

This project gave us a chance to actually build some forms, both using nearly-pure HTML and then graduating to using the helper methods that Rails provides. The full project requirements can be found in the [Odin](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/forms)

## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
$ rails test
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```
